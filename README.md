**Traffic Sign Classifier Using Convolutional Neural Networks**


The primary objective of this project was to create a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying traffic signs from a dataset of images. The model was designed to process images of traffic signs, learn distinguishing features, and predict the correct sign category with high accuracy.

The CNN-based traffic sign classifier performed exceptionally well, with a test accuracy of 98.51%. The use of data augmentation significantly contributed to the model's robustness, allowing it to generalize well to new, unseen data. The model's architecture, with its combination of convolutional, pooling, dropout, and dense layers, effectively captured the complex features of traffic signs.


This project successfully developed a CNN-based system for traffic sign classification, achieving a high accuracy of 98.51%. The model's effectiveness demonstrates the potential of CNNs in real-world applications such as autonomous driving and ADAS. Future work could explore further optimization techniques, model pruning for deployment on resource-constrained devices, and expansion to a broader range of traffic signs.
